# CheckersGUIAI
A case study I chose was option one which concerns building a graphical user interface for Checkers game (a.k.a. English Draughts) which is a two-player zero-sum perfect-information strategy game played on an 8x8 board. The application provided to me was a simple implementation of the game in C, with artificial agents as players, using ASCII graphics. My job was to implement a custom game engine using a graphical API of my choice, I decided to use Unity. The main purpose of this case study was to implement a 3D implementation of the code provided to allow the game to be played in 3D, whilst incorporating a collection of key objectives. A full description is outlined in the Assignment report and contained within is a working build that is fully playable. I have included this to show some experience with the Unity game engine, and a willingness to expand my knowledge to achieve an objective. The assignment was part of a tools, libraries and framework module in my final year's of master degree in Computer Science for games at Sheffield Hallam University.
